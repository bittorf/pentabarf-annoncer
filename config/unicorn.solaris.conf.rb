  # the following is highly recomended for Rails + "preload_app true"
  # as there's no need for the master process to hold a connection
  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!

  # The following is only recommended for memory/DB-constrained
  # installations.  It is not needed if your system can house
  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.
  #
  # # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a
  # # thundering herd (especially in the "preload_app false" case)
  # # when doing a transparent upgrade.  The last worker spawned
  # # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.
  # old_pid = "#{server.config[:pid]}.oldbin"

  # Throttle the master from forking too quickly by sleeping.  Due
  # to the implementation of standard Unix signal handlers, this
  # helps (but does not completely) prevent identical, repeated signals
  # from being lost when the receiving process is busy.

  # Unicorn master loads the app then forks off workers - because of the way
  # Unix forking works, we need to make sure we aren't using any of the parent's
  # sockets, e.g. db connection

  #ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection

  # Redis and Memcached would go here but their connections are established
  # on demand, so the master never opens a socket

  # Unicorn master is started as root, which is fine, but let's
  # drop the workers to git:git
